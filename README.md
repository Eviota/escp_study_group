# Practice for ESCP study group

- [x] Reprex is a business enterprise, its main value is its intellectual property. You must treat Reprex know-how and intellectual property a business secret. You may need to sign an non-disclousure agreement in case you get to know more in-house documents.

- [x]   Reprex is an open-source developer, and we apply the ðŸŒˆ  [Contributor's Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Participating in open source is often a highly collaborative experience, and we want to make it an experience that gives you growth and offers safety for growth. Please read the [pledge](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) that you have to make. The gist is that we have very diverse backgrounds, and norms of making suggestions, giving/recieving feedback, politeness, etc, but we all thrive to 
    - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
    - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
    - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
     - Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
     - Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community. 
     - Should you have any problems during the coursework, please reach out to Dr. Zsuzsanna Vargha or Daniel Antal, CFA. 
     
- [x] We have an onboarding manual for our projects.  You do not need to read it now at all, just know that it is there and there may be answer. [contributors.dataobservatory.eu](https://contributors.dataobservatory.eu/)
